If you choose to contribute to this project, BIG THANKS TO YOU!

We are very loose about process. If you spot a problem, create an issue.

If you fix a bug or want to add code, make a pull request and please make sure to **add tests** for the bug you fix or the feature you add. Test coverage is always an issue, and it's not getting better by having more untested code. Thanks!
