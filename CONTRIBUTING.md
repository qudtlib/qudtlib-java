If you choose to contribute to this project, BIG THANKS TO YOU!

## Issues

We are very loose about process. If you spot a problem, create an issue.

## Pull Requests

If you fix a bug or want to add code, make a pull request and please make sure to **add tests** for the bug you fix or the feature you add. Test coverage is always an issue, and it's not getting better by having more untested code. Thanks!

Also, When you make a pull request, please run `mvn install` at the top level to make sure the build succeeds.
